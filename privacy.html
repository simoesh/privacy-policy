    <hr>
    <p>This document describes the way we, at <a href="/">SimoesH.com</a>, process our users interactions with our software.</p>
    <p>We would like to begin by making clear that, currently, our income source is based solely on donations.<br/>
      In the future, we might also make subscriptions available for premium content and/or offer direct purchases to our products and services.</p>
    <p>It is important to state that we do not receive money from advertising, thus removing the principal incentive to collect and sell our users data.<br/>
      Also, we are thrilled to know our users enjoy what we do and we keep looking for meaningful improvements to our software, but not at the cost of actively tracking our users moves.<br/>
      As far as we can, we avoid taking part of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror">surveillance capitalism that is driving today's technological market</a>.</p>
    <p>We respect our users privacy and the following is a list of the data we could not avoid processing in order to make our software enjoyed by our users:<br/>
      - payment details we receive through <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>;<br/>
      - name and email of the few eventual users who manage to be invited to the <a href="/connxxis/hall-of-fame/">ConnXxis Hall of Fame</a> (after obtaining legal tutor's consent, if user is under thirteen years old);<br/>
      - ip addresses that reach our servers, together with the types of request.</p>
    <p>Note that the data we receive is not shared with third parties, can be retained for up to a year, and any personal identifiable data can be erased sooner upon request from the data owner.</p>
    <p>This document is subject to change, clarifying its language and reflecting changes to our software.<br/>
      Our core values are immutable, though, and as such we keep the changes to this privacy policy on a <a href="https://github.com/simoesh/privacy-policy/blob/main/privacy.html">publicly versioned system</a>, for transparency.</p>
    <p>Last changed on: 2021/01/17.</p>
